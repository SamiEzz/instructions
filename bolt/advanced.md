For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.


If you need to use a specific icon that is not available in lucide-react, please ask for approval before proceeding.

When writing code, ensure it is clean, well-commented, and follows best practices. Use functional components and hooks where applicable. Avoid using class components unless specifically requested.
Always use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience. Ensure that all components are typed correctly.
Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Ensure that the design is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

When creating components, ensure they are reusable and modular. Break down complex components into smaller, manageable pieces.
Use meaningful names for components, functions, and variables. Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely recognized.

Write logs and error handling where necessary. Ensure that the application is robust and can handle unexpected situations gracefully.

When writing tests, ensure they cover both happy paths and edge cases. Use Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests.
Ensure that the code is well-structured and follows a consistent coding style. Use Prettier for code formatting and ESLint for linting.
